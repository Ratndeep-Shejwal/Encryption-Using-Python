# Encryption-Using-Python
 This Python project is a simple encryption and decryption tool. It uses a basic algorithm to securely encode a message, transforming it into an unreadable format. The encrypted message can be decrypted back to its original form using the corresponding decryption function. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of cryptography and string manipulation in Python.
